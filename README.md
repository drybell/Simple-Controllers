# Simple Controllers

## Idea 

- Create a lightweight Python/JS framework to experiment with animation, mathematical problems, and solving simple problems. 

- **Current Accomplishments:** Implement PID controllers, target class, robot class, and a window handler class. 

- **Further Goals:** Implement Controllers in 3D, port everything to JS 

## Requirements 
* opencv 
* numpy 
* argparse 

## How To Run/Use

The program can be run out-of-the-box with `python3 test_window.py` to generate a couple sprites (with varying controller algorithms) that travel towards an ever-changing target (once one sprite gets close). The code also showcases some built-in methods to attach sprites to the window and running the main playback loop.
